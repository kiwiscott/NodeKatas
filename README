These are simple NodeJS Katas with some minor extensions. 

These are just learning code samples.

NOTE : I use Mocha (http://mochajs.org/) for the unit tests install globally in Node so to run the tests:
1. Install node
2."$ npm install -g mocha"
3. Browse to a 'kata directory'
4. run tests with "mocha -r Spec"


BowlingGameKata 
(There's some problems with this code I can't understand I'm going to reach out for some help). I can't figure out a good pattern for these classes or the code writer
- Bowling Kata - Based on Uncle Bob Kata which was linked from (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBowling)
- Extended to show the score board in the below format
-You can only print the score for a frame when the score is known
|__1__|__2__|__3__|__4__|__5__|__6__|__7__|__8__|__9__|__10___|
|   |X|  8|/|  3|6|   |X|  9|/|  8|/|   |X|  9|/|  9|G|  X|X|X|
|  20 |  33 |  42 |  62 |  80 | 100 | 120 | 139 | 148 |  178  |
|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_______|

FizzBuzz Node (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataFizzBuzz)
I tried to break down the function to ber human readable and create a pattern where a method, or function test, would change for one reason only. Most solutions on the internet aren't really focusing on writing better code so much as solving the problem
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
- But For multiples of 3 print “Fizz” instead of the number 
- and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
- For numbers which are multiple of both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”.

Roman Numerals (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals)
I wrote a very simple convertor after watching the video from Corey Haines (http://blog.coreyhaines.com/2012/12/roman-numerals-kata-with-commentary.html). I then added a second function to add the numerals as well.
-The Romans were a clever bunch. They conquered most of Europe and ruled it for hundreds of years. They invented concrete and straight roads and even bikinis[1]. One thing they never discovered though was the number zero. This made writing and dating extensive histories of their exploits slightly more challenging, but the system of numbers they came up with is still in use today. For example the BBC uses Roman numerals to date their programmes.
-The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to hack into stone tablets)
-The Kata says you should write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg
     1 --> I
     10 --> X
     7 --> VII
